#### By _**Andrew Lupton**_

## Description
_An intergalactic age and date calculator using Javascript._

## Specs
# The program should:
* _Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds._
* _Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)_
* _Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)_
* _Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet by calculating the user’s life expectancy._
* _If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy._
